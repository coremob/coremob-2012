        The purpose of the document is to promote understanding of which areas of Web technology are in need of development to better support the use of Web applications on mobile devices. It aims to encourage prioritization of those areas for standardization (specification, implementation, testing, and royalty free commitment).

        In order to do the above, this document presents a small number of user stories from which a set of requirement for the Web platform are derived. It goes on to list features that the underlying Web platform needs to offer to support those user stories. It then lists specifications that provide those features - and also notes the current state of development of such specifications, noting also where such specification do not at present exist.

    Introduction
    ============

Developers should be able to rely upon a set of Web technologies being consistently present and interoperably implemented across a wide range of browsers. 

Specifications do not advance at a similar rate and are not necessarily of equally widespread utility for particular application use cases. In addition, some depend on others. This document is a description of a subset of Web platform technologies, and provides for a limited, or base set of such use cases.


### Audience

The primary audience for this document is standardization groups within the W3C as well as equipment manufacturers and browser vendors. The IG also intends it to be of interest to others in its chartered constituency, especially developers, for feedback on the selection of use cases and the derivation of technology requirements from those use cases.

### Purpose of this Document

This document sets out the initial limited set of user stories; it derives requirements for the Web platform and it identifies specifications that fulfill those requirements. It does not identify tests or test suites that match those specifications.

Since standardization work is required to address the various use cases the document identifies, one of the purposes of the document is to point out that increased coordination between the groups that create standards would be beneficial in order to create a more coherent and pragmatically useful mobile Web application platform. 

The intention of this document and subsequent editions, in regard of developers, is to solicit feedback on the use cases and on specific technology areas that are problematic when used in a mobile context. Developers are especially encouraged to contribute to the work of the IG, since it is hoped that such participation will reduce future maintenance and development costs for them and will also provide a means by which developers' voices may be heard by constituencies that need to hear them.

### Aspirational nature of the document

To be clear, the IG is not expressing the judgment that it is not possible to use the Web platform to build a wide variety of applications that can be used in a mobile context. Indeed, there are applications that can be built on the Web platform that work well in a mobile delivery context. The group notes, though, that those applications are not usually specifically mobile in their use cases and tend to be similar in nature to applications that have desktop use cases as much as they have mobile use cases.

Further, the view that it is already practical to develop effective mobile Web applications is expressed with the caveat that there are many "quality of implementation" issues that developers may encounter. For example, the frame rate achievable when developing mobile games may not be sufficient, in some cases, and as another example the synchronization of playing sounds may not be adequate.

### Mobile Focus

Mobile devices often have capabilities (such as a camera) or circumstances of use (such as periods off line, or frequent periods with low bandwidth for data transfer) that make mobile both a more rewarding environment for creation of applications and a more difficult environment for such implementations too.

With the rapid increase in uptake of use of mobile devices, both in developed markets and in less developed markets (perhaps as the only means of Web access in those markets), the IG believes that closing the gap between what can be achieved using Web technology on mobile and what can be achieved using "native application implementations" needs to narrow, urgently.
    
    User stories
    =========
    
    The following user stories are designed to be illustrative and are by no means exhaustive. The basis of selection of the user stories is a [survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuIhlK0fCwP4dEFPR1pUWHk1QVczcV9xbFAtX19CMXc#gid=1) of the top native applications found in mobile application stores. Each application was assessed for its key features and prioritized according to an assessment of how many applications those features would unlock.

    The user stories chosen reflect a selection of popular applications that have been created using "native" techniques. Although the chosen set of use stories is limited, and the functionality implied by them is (relatively speaking) simple, the set of functionalities is nonetheless described as being "aspirational" because it goes beyond the state of implementation by most current browsers, and indeed goes beyond the current state of specification of some of those features - see below [aspirational nature of the document](#aspirational-nature-of-the-document) for a discussion of the aspirational aspect, as construed in this revision. 

Having identified features of the Web platform that are required to fulfill the use cases it is then possible to identify a set of specifications (or to note the absence of suitable specifications) that specify those features.

Further, having identified a set of specifications, it is then possible to identify a set of tests (or note the absence of such tests) that can be used to assess conformance with the identified specifications and also to propose a test environment in which those tests can be carried out.
    
    Take pictures in a remote area without network coverage
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Jenna is hiking in a remote area without network coverage. She takes high quality pictures using a Web application. The pictures are stored locally. She decides to post-process some of the pictures she took by applying ready made filters. She is able to continue taking pictures while the filters are applied. When she returns to an area with better network coverage, her pictures are synchronize with a remote server. While the upload is going on in the background she can continue taking pictures or can browse her previous shots to select the ones she wants to share with her friends.

    Record voice memos
    ------------------
    
    While on his morning commute, John records a short voice memo using a Web application. As he is offline, the audio file is stored locally. When he reaches the office, the audio file is asynchronously uploaded to the application's servers where it is transcribed.

    Play a 2D Game
    ---------------
    
    *Fantastic Rafaela Sis'* is a game the goal of which is to save an imprisoned prince. This is done by navigating a character, Rafaela, across various levels from left to right. Each level consist of a series of obstacles and enemies that the player has to avoid (by jumping over, shooting, etc). The character is controlled by tilting the device. Consequently, the game must be locked in landscape mode to avoid auto-rotation of the viewport interfering with the game play. It has a soundtrack per level and various sound effects.

    <a href="#req-position" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Find the nearest subway station
    -------------------------------
    
    Joe uses public transportation to visit his clients scattered around town. In order to find his way around he relies on a Web application that is able to locate him on a map, display the closest subway station and indicate in which direction he should walk to find it.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-position" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-geolocation" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Read an online magazine
    -----------------------
    
    Jane likes to read the news on her commute to work. She uses a Web application on her tablet that she updates before leaving home. While on the subway, she is able to read the daily news, watch a video of the highlights of yesterday's football match and listen to the magazine's weekly political podcast. Jane is able to navigate through the application using the back and forward button of her browser. And when she finds an article she would like to share, she is able to copy and paste the URL into an email or other application.

    <a href="#req-audio-playback" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-url-schemes" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    View a regular Web site
    ----------------------
    
    Annette is using her mobile device to access her bank's Web site. Although her bank has a dedicated native application _and_ a mobile version of its site, the information she is looking for is only available on the main site. She is nonetheless able to consult it because her mobile browser supports the same set of Web standards as her desktop browser, and is capable of displaying that information despite the difference in screen size and pixel density.

    <a href="#req-interoperability" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-mobile-specific" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Browse a responsive Web site
    ---------------------------
    
    John is en route to his dental appointment. He is late, does not have a record of his dentist's phone number in his mobile device's address book, and has a very poor network connection. Fortunately, the dentist has a responsive Web site which displays with minimal use of resources on John's mobile device. He is able to find his dentist's phone number and call her.

    <a href="#req-url-schemes" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Bookmarking a Web application
    -----------------------------
    
    Paul uses the same Web mail application on various devices and browsers. He would like to bookmark it so that it is easily recognizable across his different devices yet blends in with how other applications are portrayed in the given environment.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-meta-data" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Derived Requirements
    ====================
    
    <p class="note">Managing battery use and network connectivity (e.g. delay, throughput and cost) is an important concern on mobile devices. The IG thinks that agreement on what it is practical to measure and what actions developers might take in response to those measurements is not at a sufficiently advanced stage to posit requirements in this area.</p>
    
    The following requirements are derived from the use cases described in <a href="#use-cases" class="sectionRef"></a>. All of the requirements assume that implementers are respecting users' security and privacy.
    
    General
    -------
    
    <p id="req-interoperability" class=req>A user agent MUST support the Web platform features available on desktop browsers, so that Web applications designed for desktop are still usable on mobile.</p>
    
    <p id="req-mobile-specific" class=req>The user agent MUST be able to display content specifically targeted at mobile devices.</p>
    
    <p id="req-responsive" class=req>The user agent MUST be able to perform [reactive content negotiation](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-24#section-3.4) specifically targeted at mobile devices.

    <p id="req-offline" class=req>It MUST be possible to make an application and relevant content available off-line.</p>
    
    <p id="req-history" class=req>The user agent MUST allow the application developer to define URLs for chosen resources (for example for bookmarking or sharing) and to manipulate session history for single page applications.</p>
    
    <p id="req-app-look" class=req>It MUST be possible for Web application user interfaces to occupy all the screen space yet adapt to different screen sizes without leaving unused space or overflowing.</p>
    
    <p id="req-app-feel" class=req>It MUST be possible for Web application user interfaces to transition smoothly from one state to another.</p>
    
    <p id="req-fast-scroll" class=req>It MUST be possible to scroll smoothly through a large body of content.</p>
    
    <p id="req-orientation-lock" class=req>A Web application might be designed to be used strictly in portrait or landscape mode. It MUST be possible to signal this preference to the user agent.</p>
    
    <p id="req-fullscreen" class=req>It MUST be possible for an application to signal to the user agent that it wants to operate full screen and not inside the user agent's chrome.</p>
    
    Storage
    -------
    
    <p id="req-data-storage" class=req>It MUST be possible to store and retrieve large, structured, persistent data sets (e.g., files and other binary blobs). This MUST NOT interrupt the ability of the user to interact with the application.</p>

    Multimedia
    ----------
    
    <p id="req-camera-access" class=req>It MUST be possible to take pictures using the device's camera. </p>
    
    <p id="req-microphone-access" class=req>It MUST be possible to record audio clips using the device's microphone.</p>
    
    <p id="req-pic-manipulation" class=req>It MUST be possible to programmatically manipulate a picture so as to crop it, apply filters to it, etc. and save the result of these manipulations. This MUST NOT interrupt the ability of the user to interact with the application.</p>
    
    <p id="req-framerate" class=req>It MUST be possible for the user agent to efficiently manage animation timing through, for example, hardware accelaration and/or synchronization with the refresh rate of the display.</p>
    
    <p id="req-audio-playback" class=req>It MUST be possible to play Multiple sound files simultaneously with minimal latency.</p>
    
    Sensors
    -------
    
    <p id="req-position" class=req>It MUST be possible for the application to register to receive updates when the position of the device changes.</p>
    
    <p id="req-geolocation" class=req>It MUST be possible to obtain the device's current geographic coordinates provided the user consents to sharing those.</p>
    
    Networking
    ----------
    
    <p id="req-file-upload" class=req>It MUST be possible to upload files to remote server on different origins. Uploads SHOULD continue even if the user navigates to a different page.</p>
    
    <p id="req-url-schemes" class=req>URI schemes SHOULD be associate URI schemes, such as `mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:` and `mmsto:`, with appropriate handlers. These handlers can be either other applications on the device or web applications.</p>
    
    Specifications which address the derived requirements
    =====================================================
    
    This section lists existing specifications which address the requirements expressed in <a href="#derived-requirements" class="sectionRef"></a> and notes their current state of standardization (progress along [W3C Rec Track](http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#maturity-levels) is noted using conventional abbreviations).

    The document <cite>[Standards for Web Applications on Mobile: current state and roadmap](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/)</cite> is regularly updated to reflect current status both of standardization and of implementation of many of the same standards.

    <p class="note">The IG has had frequent cause to discuss whether or not it needs to make reference to **the whole** of a referenced specification. In the course of such discussions it has frequently re-iterated that it is not its role to cherry-pick parts of the specifications produced by other groups. Equally, however, it has frequently noted that its use cases require only sub-sections of referenced specifications. The IG has observed that the WGs responsible for producing such specifications might choose to subset their work to advance speed of specification, modularity of testing, and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="note">The IG notes that simple interoperability of video and audio content is highly desirable. The IG also notes that considerations regarding such interoperability concern all aspects of the use of such content on the Web (and are not of more concern in mobile than elsewhere).</p>

    Requirements only partially addressed by existing specifications
    ================================================================
    
    The following requirements are only partially addressed by existing specifications: <a href="#req-interoperability" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-mobile-specific" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-responsive" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-meta-data" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-offline" class="reqRef"></a>, and
    <a href="#req-orientation-lock" class=reqRef></a>.
    
    There is ongoing work to address each of those requirements within W3C as detailed below. The IG encourages these efforts.
    
    Pointer events
    --------------
    
    While <a href="#req-interoperability" class="reqRef"></a> and <a href="#req-mobile-specific" class="reqRef"></a> are generally addressed by a number of existing specifications, there is one area which is still problematic - user input. Touch-enabled devices delay click inputs (presumably to handle long and double taps). While there are some [different](https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons) [solutions](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) that remove the delay, developers tend to rely instead on touch events [[TOUCH-EVENTS]]. In turn, this creates content which doesn't work properly when used with a different kind of input mechanism. In order to address this situation, the [Pointer Event WG](http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/) was formed and has published a first Working Draft [[POINTER-EVENTS]].
    
    Responsive Images
    -----------------
    
    While a lot has been done to address <a href="#req-responsive" class="reqRef"></a>, notably through media queries, there is no set solution for responsive images to date. The [Responsive Images CG](http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/) has made a proposal ([The picture element](http://picture.responsiveimages.org/)), and so has the HTML WG ([The srcset attribute](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/Overview.html)). The HTML WG is set to determine the merit of both solutions and examine whether they should be combined.
    
    Application meta-data
    ---------------------
    
    The multitude of existing formats to describe application meta-data (<a href="#req-meta-data" class="reqRef"></a>) have been [listed](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/installable-web-apps-and-interoperability/) [elsewhere](http://blog.tobie.me/post/14262541286/app-manifests-an-anthology) already. The WebApps WG is [chartered](http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html#deliverables) to work on this and has two related specs: <cite>Packaged Web Apps (Widgets) - Packaging and XML Configuration</cite> [[WIDGETS]] (which has gotten little traction among the main vendors), and Web Application Manifest Format and Management APIs [[WEBAPPS-MANIFEST-API]] (which is still an early Editor's draft). Additionally, the combination of a number of [[HTML5]] features, such as the `title` element, `meta` application-name element and `link` icons element provides similar capabilities, yet this solution lacks sufficient comprehensiveness and cohesiveness to meet the requirements.
    
    Offline
    -------
    
    Currently, Application Cache is the only Web technology designed to address <a href="#req-offline" class="reqRef"></a>. Its issues have already been [exhaustively](http://www.w3.org/2011/web-apps-ws/Report) [documented](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/appcache-london) [elsewhere](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/appcache). This technology is very complex, poorly understood, and hard to use. It is also [marked at risk](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/#status-of-this-document) in the HTML5 specification.
    
    Recently, the [WebApps WG has decided to take over this work](http://www.w3.org/2012/10/30-webapps-minutes.html#item06) with the blessing of the HTML WG. In parallel, the [Fixing Application Cache CG](http://www.w3.org/community/fixing-appcache/) is collecting case studies, use cases and requirements.
    
    Screen Orientation
    ------------------
    
    A specification to fulfill <a href="#req-orientation-lock" class=reqRef></a> is a deliverable of the WebApps WG. A first public Working Draft [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] was recently published by the WG. The CG encourages the WG to explore other solutions such as a JavaScript API for [[CSS-ADAPTATION]] which already has an `orientation` property.
    
    
    Unaddressed requirements
    ========================
    
    The following requirements aren't addressed by existing specifications: <a href="#req-fast-scroll" class=reqRef></a>, and <a href="#req-fullscreen" class=reqRef></a>.
    
    However, there is early work going on to address some of these.
    
    Momentum and infinite scrolling
    -------------------------------
    
    Smooth and stutter-free scrolling is first and foremost a QoI issue. However, the requirements (maintaining 60fps while possibly altering the DOM) are sufficiently taxing that they are difficult to meet on mobile devices, even on high-end ones. Some [very recent work](http://fremycompany.com/TR/2012/ED-css-viewport/) attempts to cater to this issue.
    
    Chromeless Mode
    ---------------
    
    While within the scope of the WebApps WG's [charter](http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/), no work that would address <a href="#req-fullscreen" class=reqRef></a> is currently ongoing.
    
    
    Quality of Implementation
    =========================
    
    The CG notes that functional conformance to specifications is sometimes insufficient to create a functional user experience of Web applications. There are many areas in which non-functional (or QoI) requirements have been noted, relating to speed, time related consistency (smoothness) and so on. 
    
    The group's work to date has yielded the following particular points of note:
    
    QoI of the `audio` element
    --------------------------
    
    Implementors should pay particular attention to the quality of implementation of the `audio` element. `audio` elements are commonly used in games to play background music and sound effects. It is recommended that implementations support playing 8 audio files in parallel without audible artifacts and provide sub 10ms latency.
    
    Performance of the `canvas` element
    -----------------------------------
    
    Implementors should pay attention to the performance characteristics of the `canvas` element which is used for the development of 2D and isometric games. In order to meet the expectations of users, implementations should be capable of running such games at 30fps in full-screen mode.
    
    Performance of scrolling, transitions, and animations
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Smooth scrolling, transitions, and animations are key to delivering great user experiences. Implementations should aim to render these at 60fps.
    
    Dedicated form controls
    -----------------------
    
    On mobile devices content input is often tedious. Implementors should therefore implement dedicated form controls where appropriate (for example, displaying a numerical keypad for inputs of type `tel`).
